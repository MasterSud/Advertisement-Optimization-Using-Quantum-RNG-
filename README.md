# Advertisement Optimization using Quantum RNG

## Description

Advertisement Optimization using Quantum RNG is a project designed to optimize the scheduling of advertisements based on priority levels while incorporating quantum random number generation to enhance the randomness of advertisement placements. By leveraging quantum randomness, the project aims to keep viewers intrigued and engaged, ultimately maximizing the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

## Project Objectives

1. **Priority-Based Scheduling:** Schedule advertisements based on their priority levels to ensure high-priority ads receive optimal placement.
   
2. **Quantum RNG Integration:** Incorporate quantum random number generation to introduce an additional layer of randomness in advertisement scheduling, enhancing viewer engagement.
   
3. **Customization:** Allow users to customize priority levels, advertisement duration, target audience, and other parameters to tailor the optimization process according to specific campaign requirements.
   
4. **Scalability:** Design the project to handle a large number of advertisements and scheduling scenarios, making it suitable for various advertising campaigns.

## Expected Deliverables

1. A software solution capable of optimizing advertisement scheduling using priority-based algorithms and quantum random number generation.
   
2. User documentation providing instructions on how to use the software and customize parameters for specific advertising campaigns.
   
3. Source code repository containing the project codebase, including any necessary dependencies and documentation.
